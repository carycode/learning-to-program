Every good programmer knows several computer languages, because some things that are difficult (or impossible!) to do in one language are easy (or at least possible) in another, and vice versa.

Taking advice from

http://wiki.c2.com/?FreshmansFirstLanguage["Freshmans First Language: What programming language should we teach freshmen first?"]

I think I'm going to recommed starting with

* Python, for both general-purpose apps and dynamic web pages
(Merging the forked Wikibooks 
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Think_Python
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/How_to_Think_Like_a_Computer_Scientist:_Learning_with_Python_2nd_Edition
)

* HTML
* CSS
* regex

and then later, if you want to go into more depth,

* Circuit Python
* "Arduino" (C++) ?
* ASCIIdoc
* nginx or lighttpd ?
* PM2 ?
