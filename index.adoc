Educational computer language resources, links, etc.

Every good programmer knows several computer languages, because some things that are difficult (or impossible!) to do in one language are easy (or at least possible) in another, and vice versa.

Syllabus

Taking advice from

http://wiki.c2.com/?FreshmansFirstLanguage["Freshmans First Language: What programming language should we teach freshmen first?"]


I think I'm going to recommed starting with

* Python, for both general-purpose apps and dynamic web pages
(Merging the forked Wikibooks 
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Think_Python
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/How_to_Think_Like_a_Computer_Scientist:_Learning_with_Python_2nd_Edition
)
* HTML

with perhaps some simple spirals / beeps / games?

Programming tools:
* text editor (vim, emacs, etc)
* single-step debuggers (JavaScript debuggers; Spyder-IDE Python debugger, etc.)
* mercurial, TortoiseHG, git, etc. with gitlab, github, etc.
** https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/["GitHub Guides: Hello World"]

Then the fairly important widely-used domain-specific languages (DSL)

* CSS
* regex

perhaps building a demo website under the GNU Affero General Public License that complies with that license
in an unnecessarily complex way by,
quine-like,
both executing the dynamic website normally
and also allowing a user to download a copy of the currently-running Python script(s).
(Also do the normal thing and simply link to the upstream repository).

* crontab
to pull the latest version of the website from gitlab or github upstream repository.

and then later, if you want to go into more depth,

some discussion on the distinction between

* fully general-purpose programming language and
* more limited domain-specific languages and
* even more limited markup languages,

and some discussion on why *don't* we write everything in the "most powerful" language:

* "principle of least power"
* common things in a very specialized domains are quicker (?) to express with a DSL ("more expressive") than expressing the same thing in a general-purpose programming language.
* Many simple tools, loosely coupled: the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy["Unix philosophy"], command-line pipeline, and bash scripting

Lower-level languages:

* Circuit Python
* "Arduino" (C++) ?

Higher-level languages

* ASCIIdoc
* https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Web_Programming["Web Programming"] -- JavaScript, etc.
** Object-oriented programming in JavaScript
* nginx or lighttpd ?
* PM2 ?
* R Studio
* Octave ?

* Android (all the following should probably be moved to https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Android )
* "Android Studio" (Kotlin or Java?)
